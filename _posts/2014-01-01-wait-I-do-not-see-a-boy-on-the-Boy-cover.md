##Wait!! I don't see a boy on the Boy cover!!

That's probably because you have the U.S. release of the album, which was censored / edited by Warner Records for fear of paedophilia claims. 

The cover was changed in the States because of "a vague worry at the label that there might be a homosexual impression left from the boy's waist-up nakedness." (quote from former Principle Mgmt. director Ellen Darst) [SL, RA, Ge]
