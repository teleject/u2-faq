This is very boring. U2 lack the emotional roster of big bands like Pink Floyd and the Beatles when it comes to band breakup rumors and gossip. They have always had the same members and it's not bound to change in the near future. The four guys seem to be good friends. [SL]

The band were advised to dump Larry, in the early days (by a record company). [CB]
