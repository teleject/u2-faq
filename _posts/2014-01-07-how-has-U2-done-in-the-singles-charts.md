The easy answer would be "quite well". It is more difficult than that, as each country maintains its own charting system, and some countries have multiple charts. How various charts are measured has also changed througout U2's career.

In the U.S., U2 had their first number one single with "With or Without You". In the U.K., their first number one single was "Desire". 

When looking at albums, *War* was the first number one album in the U.K., and *The Joshua Tree* was the first number one album in the U.S. 

Other singles to make it to number one during U2's career are as follows:

* I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For (U.S.)
* The Fly (U.K. and Australia)
* Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me (Australia)
* Discotheque (U.K.)
* Beautiful Day (U.K. and Australia)
* Vertigo (U.K.)
* All Because of You (Canada)
