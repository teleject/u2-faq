The title of the movie will be listed first, followed by U2's contribution, and the year of release. 

Note that U2's most successful contribution to a movie would have to be the original song, "Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me" which was on the Batman Forever soundtrack. 

The song was released as a single with other tracks from the movie, and the single reached number 2 in the UK charts, number 1 in Australia, number 11 in Canada and number 16 in the U.S.
