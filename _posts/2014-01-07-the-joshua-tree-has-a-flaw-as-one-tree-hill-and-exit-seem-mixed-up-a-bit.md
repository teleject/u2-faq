    Discography: I think my copy of The Joshua Tree has a flaw - "One Tree Hill" and "Exit" seem mixed up a bit?

There is an editing problem with many copies of *The Joshua Tree*. 

At the end of "One Tree Hill" there is a moment of silence and then the song comes back with the lines "Oh great ocean, oh great sea, run to the ocean, run to the sea". 

The silence before this track has created a mastering problem. On some copies this section of "One Tree Hill" is included at the start of "Exit" instead.

In the correct form "One Tree Hill" runs 5:23 and "Exit" runs 4:13. 

This is a widespread problem with pressings of *The Joshua Tree* on CD, and is far from 'rare'. [AS]
