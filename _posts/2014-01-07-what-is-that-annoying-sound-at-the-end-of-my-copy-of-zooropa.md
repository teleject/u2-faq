If you leave Zooropa playing for about one minute after "The Wanderer", you will hear an alarm going off. 

This is the same alarm which warns radio DJ's when there is a 10 second air silence. 

Some editions of Zooropa don't have the DJ alarm at the end -- the Brazillian pressing, for example. [TVT, CG]
