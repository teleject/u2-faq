The extra music is found on early vinyl pressings of Boy. 

It was removed from later pressings of the vinyl and does not appear on any CD pressings of the album. 

The music itself is a short 25 second instrumental track with a very low volume in comparison to other tracks on the vinyl.

It sounds like an early version of the track "Fire" which appeared on the October album. [EN]
